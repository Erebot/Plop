     * Construct a new instance of this handler.
     *
     * \param string $filename
     *      Name of the log file to write to.
     *
     * \param int $maxBytes
     *      The maximum size the log file may occupy, in bytes.
     *
     * \param int $backupCount
     *      (optional) Specifies how many backup logs are kept
     *      alongside the current log file.
     *      Backup logs are named after the date and time
     *      at which they were created. The exact format
     *      depends on the value of the \a $when parameter.
     *      The default value is 0, which disables deletion
     *      of old backups.
     *
     * \param string $mode
     *      (optional) Mode to use when opening
     *      the file. Defauts to "at" (append).
     *
     * \param bool $delay
     *      (optional) Whether to delay the actual
     *      opening of the file until the first write.
     *      Defaults to \a false (no delay).
     *
     * \note
     *      Depending on your installation, values bigger
     *      than 1\<\<31 (2 GB) for the \a $maxBytes parameter
     *      may not work correctly.
