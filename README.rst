Python-like Logging On PHP
==========================

Plop was originally a port of Python's logging module to PHP,
and so its API bears many similarities with that of its Python
counterpart. But as time went by, the code underwent several
major rewrites to make it easier to use and maintain.

Plop aims at providing an efficient logging API while being
more feature-complete than PEAR's Log package and
more user-friendly than Apache's log4php.
