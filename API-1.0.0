API release notes for Plop version 1.0.0
----------------------------------------

The code underwent a major rewrite, breaking backward compatability.
To use Plop:

1.  Make sure you use a PSR-0 compatible class loader, such as PEAR2's
    autoloader.
2.  Grab an instance with:
    $logger = Plop::getInstance();
3.  (Optional) Configure logging. See the documentation for more
    information.
4.  Log as much as you want, eg.
    $logger->error('This should not happen!');
    $logger->debug('Current PID: %(pid)s', array('pid' => getmypid()));
