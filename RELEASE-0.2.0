Release notes for Plop version 0.2.0
------------------------------------

Plop is now structured using PEAR2's standard directory layout.
This way, it can be packaged as a PEAR2 package.
For now, the code does not follow PEAR2's conventions strictly,
to maintain PHP 5.2.x compatibility.

The latest (packaged) version of Plop will be available on Erebot's
pear repository (pear.erebot.net).
Follow the instructions at http://pear.erebot.net/ to install it.

Nothing else was changed in this release, but due to the numerous
compatibility breaks this caused, there was a need for a new release.
Even if this release is marked as minor, it's still a pretty big one!
