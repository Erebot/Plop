Prerequisites
=============

This page assumes that the reader has a working PHP setup (either installed
using some distribution's package manager or manually) and lists
the dependencies required to use Plop.
In case you compiled PHP yourself, you may need to recompile it to include
additional extensions (see the list of required PHP dependencies in the section
entitled `Getting started`_ for more information).

Plop is known to work with most PHP versions.
Plop should run correctly on both Windows (XP or later) and Linux (most distros).
The code is tested using an automated process on Windows Vista (64 bits),
Windows 7 (64 bits), Windows 8.1 (64 bits), Debian Stable (64 bits)
and CentOS 6 (64 bits), as reflected by our `Continuous Integration server`_.
