Contributing
============

So, you took interest in Plop and would like to contribute back?
This is the right page!

There are actually several ways by which you may contribute
to the project:

*   by `reporting new issues`_ (or asking for new features)
*   by forking the code and `sending pull requests`_

Whichever one it is, you may also `join our IRC channel`_ to discuss issues,
new ideas / feature requests and follow Plop's development.

..  _`pull requests`:

Code/patch
----------

If you plan on sending patches (or pull requests), please read our
documentation on the `coding standard`_ used by Plop's developers first.
Your patch will have greater chances to be approved if it abides by that
standard when you submit it.

To contribute a patch, you will need a GitHub account. Then you can simply:

-   `Fork the code`_ to your own account.
-   Create a new branch.
-   Patch things up as much as you want.
-   Create a pull request with your changes.

Once your pull request has been received, it will undergo a review process
to decide whether it can be accepted as-is, needs more changes before having
a chance to be accepted or is utterly rejected.
