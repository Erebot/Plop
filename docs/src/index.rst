Welcome to Plop's documentation!
================================

Plop is a logging library loosely based on Python's logging module
and therefore bears similarities with it.
The code underwent major changes though, so as to make it easier
to use with Dependency Injection Containers.
The API makes heavy use of chainable method calls, making it very intuitive.
