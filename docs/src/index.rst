Welcome to Plop's documentation!
================================

Plop is a logging library based on Python's logging module and therefore
bears similarities with it. The code underwent major changes though,
so as to make it easier to use with Dependency Injection Containers.
The API makes heavy use of chainable method calls, making it very intuitive.
